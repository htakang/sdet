## Description of the Repository ##
* This project extends the e-commerce API of Neoteric Innovations to make it possible for customers to pay for their services directly from their website.

* This project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the Frontend. For the backend it will use Node.js and MySql for the database

* HTML, CSS and JavaSript were used for the frontend because the users will interact with the API on their web browser

* Node.js was used for the backend to provide single use of the same programming language in the frontend and backend

* Express.JS was used for the on top of Node.js to facilate routing and  connection to the Database. 

* MySql was used for the Database because it is easy to use, highly efficient and there is a large community of developers that that can provide support in case of difficulties. MySQL is one of the widely used database engines in the world and with Node it really works very well. Node MySQL pooling and event-based debugging are really powerful.
